**Disclaimer**

I am not the original author of this software. I've taken this excellent package by Philippe Maegerman
and merely built it into a single file which does not pollute the main javascript namespace, and
can be optionally minified.


** Requirements **

Apache Ant  1.7 or greater
Java 1.6 or greater

** Enhancements **

All tweening classes are under the main name space Tween
e.g.

var t = new Tween()
var c = new Tween.ColorTween()
var o = new Tween.OpacityTween()
var t = new Tween.TextTween()
var s = new Tween.Sequence()
var p = new Tween.Parallel()


I've left the source files themselves more or less in tact

** Compilation **

run ant from the main directory.
